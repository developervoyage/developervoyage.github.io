<p>I first heard about <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a> on a podcast a couple of months ago, and it sparked my interest since I've become more involved in open-source software projects lately. Hacktoberfest is a month-long event with the purpose of celebrating open-source software. The event is run by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/hacktoberfest-completion-thread-2n6a">dev.to</a>. Having lived in Munich for a couple of years, I, of course, find the name of the event amusing as well. </p>

<p>To participate, you need to sign up at <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com</a> anytime between October 1 and October 31. Within the same time period, you need to submit at least four pull requests to public <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repositories. When you have done this, you will receive a Hacktoberfest T-shirt if you are one of the first 50,000 participants to successfully complete the Hacktoberfest challenge.</p>

<p>I think that this is an excellent event to promote open-source software, and I registered a few days ago. Once I got started, I was so inspired that I ended up creating more than double the amount of pull requests needed to receive the T-shirt. </p>

<p>My main focus was on <a href="https://github.com/larshp/abapOpenChecks">abapOpenChecks</a>, which is a GitHub repository providing open-source checks for SAP Code Inspector / ABAP Test Cockpit. I use this tool on a daily basis, so it feels great to be able to give back to the community of the project. I also created some minor pull requests for <a href="https://github.com/Kodcentrum/Scratchuppgifter-v3">Kodboken.se</a>, which is the educational material used by <a href="https://www.kodcentrum.se/">Kodcentrum</a> where I'm volunteering as a coding instructor.</p>

<p>If you haven't previously contributed to open-source software, this is the perfect time to get started! If you are already an open-source veteran, why not contribute some more and potentially receive a cool T-shirt?</p>

<p>I wish you a great October and happy coding!</p>
