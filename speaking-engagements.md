Are you organizing a meetup or a conference related to SAP, ABAP, clean code, DDD, TDD, or any other topic that I cover on the blog? Are you running a software-related podcast?

I'd be happy to talk about the topics covered on the blog at a conference, a meetup, or on a podcast. Please <a href="./about/">contact me</a> so that we can discuss some ideas! I'm located in Sweden.

### 2019-11-05: [SAPSA](https://sapsa.se/) IMPULS 2019

I held a talk titled [Improving your ABAP code quality with open-source tools](https://github.com/jwigert/sapsa-impuls-2019-jw/blob/master/F%C3%B6rb%C3%A4ttra%20kvaliteten%20p%C3%A5%20din%20ABAP-kod%20med%20hj%C3%A4lp%20av%20%C3%B6ppen%20k%C3%A4llkod-verktyg.pdf). The talk was about how we have improved our code quality through the use of open-source tools at the organization where I work. The tools I explained and demonstrated are:

- [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit): Git client for ABAP
- [abapOpenChecks](https://github.com/larshp/abapOpenChecks): Checks for SAP Code Inspector
- [SAP Style guides](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides): Clean coding recommendations for ABAP

### 2019-11-04: [SAPSA](https://sapsa.se/) IMPULS 2019

I held a presentation titled [How to stay up-to-date within the SAP space with openSAP](https://github.com/jwigert/sapsa-impuls-2019-jw/blob/master/Hur%20du%20h%C3%A5ller%20dig%20uppdaterad%20inom%20SAP-omr%C3%A5det%20med%20hj%C3%A4lp%20av%20openSAP.pdf). [openSAP](https://open.sap.com) is an excellent MOOC platform to stay current with the SAP space and acquire new skills. I explained the structure and advantages of using MOOCs in general and openSAP in particular, to expand my knowledge within SAP. I also shared my personal experiences attending about 30 openSAP courses.
